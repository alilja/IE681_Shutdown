Requirements and Installation
-----------------------------

See the `requirements.txt` file. Installation is easy:

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

You should probably run this in a virtual environment.


Execution
---------

Also simple. From the directory that contains `shutdown/`:

    $ python shutdown

Otherwise,

    $ ./__main__.py
